# Requirements : -
1. if unique properties object are adding with our project.(wooden-duck->duck but cant fly) and so on.
2. If we have to change only properties of object like.(eating-behaviour), (fly-behaviour), (Wearing-behaviour).


# Tips in Strategy Pattern:-

1. Make heirarical behavior seperate & properties behaviour seperate.
2. create interfaces for properties(contract - scopes).
3. Use has-a relation of properties.
4. Add Properties in constructor. IE.when we are creating an object & adding properties to it.(like making maggi).
